# Explaining the Predictions of the MOSNet Classifier via the LIME Framework
mplementation of paper: ["'Why Should I Trust You?' Explaining the Predictions of any Classifier"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf). By modifying the proposed framework to work for [MOSNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08352.pdf), we attempt to draw conclusions about which features are particularly relevant during audio classification.

## Project Deliverables
- [Code](https://github.com/abarach/mosnet-lime)
- [Presentation slides](https://buckeyemailosu-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/lamba_39_buckeyemail_osu_edu/Documents/2023.12.04_FinalProjectPresentation_Lamba_Sowah.pptx?d=wc18f462a9f3b4b0fb0672785b4bc809a&csf=1&web=1&e=or9dcY)
- *Paper*

## File Structure
The file structure is modified from the [original MOSNet implementation](https://github.com/lochenchou/MOSNet).
- `data` contains scripts and tables delineating the VCC Voice Conversion Dataset used to train MOSNet. 
- `lime` contains a copy of the LIME framework implementation.
- `pre_trained` contains pre-trained `.h5` files for three different MOSNet versions: CNN, CNN + BLSTM, and BLSTM.
- `model.py` defines the MOSNet model object.
- `mosnet_lime.py` **is the code written for this project**.
- `original_MOSNET_README.md` is the original README for the MOSNet implementation. 
- `requirements.txt` lists the library dependencies for the project. 
- `test.py`, `train.py`, `custom_test.py`, and `utils.py` are training, testing, and utility scripts for MOSNet. 

## MOSNet Framework
MOSNet is a convolution and recurrent neural network proposed by Lo et al. in 2021 [2]. It takes the magnitude spectrogram of an audio signal as input and predicts the [mean opinion score (MOS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_opinion_score) of the signal. 

## LIME Explanations 
The LIME framework attempts to explain a classifier's prediction by using an already-interpretable model which locally approximates the target classifier [1]. 

## Project Status
`mosnet_lime.py` initializes the LIME explainer and MOSNet pre-trained model. 

## To Do
*Final Presentation*: Monday, December 4, 2023 </br>
*Slides, Code, and Paper due*: Tuesday, December 5, 2023

- Predict MOS score for a sample input.
- Generate a LIME explanation for that sample input.
- Generalize the script to predict and explain several data inputs. 
- Write paper. 
- Write presentation slides.
